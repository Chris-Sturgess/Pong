This is a first test of LOVE. It's a basic PONG game for two players. I should be able to polish this off quickly to get what I need.

##Particulars
-Animation
-Images
-Keyboard Input
-Menu
-Mouse Input
-File I/O

If I can do this easily, I think I've found the engine I can use to build Rise of Machina: Part i.

This also includes a quick script I wrote to automatically create a directory for new LOVE games.
