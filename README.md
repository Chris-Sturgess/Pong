This is a first test of LOVE. It's a basic PONG game for two players. I should be able to polish this off quickly to get what I need.

##Particulars
* Animation
* Images
* Keyboard Input
* Menu
* Mouse Input
* File I/O

If I can do this easily, I think I've found the engine I can use to build Rise of Machina: Part i.

This also includes a quick script I wrote to automatically create a directory for new LOVE games.

##Dev Log

#Part 1: Images

I'm using the built in function to add 4 images to the screen. I'll import the ball, change the BG for the background, and draw the paddles as rectangles. Then, I'll use the built in text functions to display a scoreboard at the top. Also, because nobody is reading this, I'm watching Inception right now. It's deep, man. Deep.
