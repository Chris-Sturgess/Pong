This is a first test of LOVE. It's a basic PONG game for two players. I should be able to polish this off quickly to get what I need.

##Particulars
* Animation
* Images
* Keyboard Input
* Menu
* Mouse Input
* File I/O
* Multiple Files

If I can do this easily, I think I've found the engine I can use to build Rise of Machina: Part i.

This also includes a quick script I wrote to automatically create a directory for new LOVE games.

##Dev Log

###Part 1: Images

I'm using the built in function to add 4 images to the screen. I'll import the ball, change the BG for the background, and draw the paddles as rectangles. Then, I'll use the built in text functions to display a scoreboard at the top. Also, because nobody is reading this, I'm watching Inception right now. It's deep, man. Deep.

I've added image input, but now I'm thinking that I should add multiple files to this. I'm going to need to. I should be able to work it with two extras, one for the ball and one for the paddles. Score can be taken care of in the main file. Also, Inception wedding ring. Like I said. Deep. Literally, man.

I added in a score system and learned how to add in the fonts. Now, it's all set up, I need to add logics. Now, I'm going to add separate files to help with organization. Also: Castle, watch Castle. You have GOT to love Nathan Fillion.

###Part 2: Multiple Files
